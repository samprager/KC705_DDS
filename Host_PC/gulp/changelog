Version 1.58, published Mar 18, 2008
 - if packets are dropped, emit system tuning suggestion
 - fix Makefile so check64bit runs even if user doesn't have . in $PATH

Version 1.57, published Feb 20, 2008
 - added capture-to-file options: -o, -C, -W (see updated manpage)
 - added explanation about 64 bit interoperability problems to documentation
   and explained the preferred solution, see:
   http://staff.washington.edu/corey/gulp/gulp.html#64bit
 - added test in Gulp's Makefile: if 64 bit linux issue warning and URL above
 - added conditional code of last resort to try to generate (though not read)
   32-bit capture files with the 64-bit pcap library (a last resort)
 - made -s # refer to decapsulated snaplen if -d is also specified.  Made file
   header agree with decapsulated length too (although I don't know of
   anything which breaks if the snaplen in the file header is incorrect).
 - added information about using taskset(1) to writeup and manpage (for even
   better performance in a pipeline if more than 2 CPUs are available).
 - fixed ifdef JUSTCOPY (which was slightly broken in 1.49).
 - improved diagnostics if argument to -V begins with - (probable mistake)

Version 1.49, published Aug 9, 2007
 - initial public release
