<h1> Xilinx PCIe_DMA_DDR3_BASE Targeted Reference Design for Kintex-7 </h1></div>
The Xilinx Kintex-7 BaseTRD consists of a base driver providing 
packet DMA capabilities, and layered above that are application-specific 
drivers. The base DMA driver (xdma) provides a set of application 
programming interfaces (APIs) as an interface to the application drivers. 

<p>
In this design, the application-specific drivers are a Xilinx Raw Data0 
(xrawdata0) driver and a Xilinx Raw Data1 (xrawdata1) driver. 

<h2> Xilinx DMA Base Driver (xdma) </h2>
This is the Xilinx Scatter Gather DMA driver for the Northwest Logic 
Multi-Channel Packet DMA IP. Each DMA engine may either be for Transmit 
(System-to-Card or S2C) or Receive (Card-to-System or C2S) operations. 
Each application driver instance supports one S2C and one C2S DMA engine, 
allowing full-duplex operation per driver instance. In this way, the TRD
design supports four DMA engines in all, two of each type. 

<h2> Xilinx Raw Data0 Driver (xrawdata0) </h2>
This driver provides a simple data generation capability. Generated data
is transmitted via DMA into the DDR3 memory and read back from 
memory into the driver, again via DMA. Data verification can be enabled on 
received data. This has been disabled by default because it causes
reduced performance.

<h2> Xilinx Raw Data1 Driver (xrawdata1) </h2>
This driver provides a simple data generation capability. Generated data
is transmitted via DMA into the DDR3 memory and read back from 
memory into the driver, again via DMA. Data verification can be enabled on 
received data. This has been disabled by default because it causes
reduced performance.
